# Bazaar - Multipurpose Ecommerce Template

> A professional, mobile friendly, server side rendered ecommerce template. A clean and clear codebase allows you to easily understand its structure and build your ecommerce store.

## Requirements

Make sure that you have the last stable `Node` and `npm` version.

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Do not delete the `package-lock.json / yarn.lock file`

## Install

Navigate to the project root folder using terminal and install the dependencies.

```shell copy
npm install
```

**Or**

```shell copy
yarn install
```

## Run development server

After the installation is complete, you can launch your app by running.

```shell copy
npm run dev
```

or

```shell copy
yarn dev
```

This starts a local webserver at `http://localhost:3000` and auto detect file changes:

```shell
yarn run v1.22.18
$ next dev
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
```

npm run build
```

or

```shell
yarn build
```
