# Folder Structure

> **/pages/\_app.tsx** is the main entry file. Next.js follows file system based routing. Each file in `pages` folder is a route.

> Component structure are straight forward.

- Reusable atomic components are located in `src/components`
- Layout components are located in `src/components/layouts`. Read more at [Layout documentation](/layouts)
- Bigger static components are located in `src/page-sections`
  - Static component means, these components has static data which you need to modify
